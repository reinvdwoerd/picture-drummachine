Picture-drummachine is like Ableton&rsquo;s Drum Rack, but for images instead of sounds.
It accepts midi input and draws a picture whenever a note is sent.
You can control it with a midi controller or any (music) software.
Images or animated gifs can be dragged in from the file explorer or directly from the browser.



Requirements:

- On Windows, loopMIDI is an easy way to create midi ports

- For controlling with midi, your browser needs to support WebMidi. 
  Chrome supports it out of the box, for Firefox you can install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/" target="_blank">Jazz-Midi by Jazz-Soft</a>.

- To copy pictures from Google Images you need <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf" target="_blank">this extension</a>.
